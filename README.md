# MIPS 32 Processor

This repository contains an implementation of a MIPS 32-bit processor. The MIPS architecture is a widely used instruction set architecture in the field of computer architecture and digital design. This project aims to provide a functional and educational implementation of a MIPS processor.

## Introduction

The MIPS 32 Processor is an implementation of the MIPS (Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages) architecture. This architecture is known for its simplicity and elegance, making it a great starting point for learning about computer organization and architecture.

## Features

- **RISC Architecture:** The MIPS architecture follows the Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) design principles, focusing on simplicity and efficiency.

- **32-bit Addressing:** The processor uses 32-bit instructions and a 32-bit address space.

- **Five-Stage Pipeline:** The processor includes a five-stage pipeline (Instruction Fetch, Instruction Decode, Execute, Memory, Writeback), enabling efficient instruction execution.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

List any prerequisites that users need to have in order to run or simulate the MIPS processor. For example:

- A Verilog simulator (e.g., ModelSim, Xilinx Vivado)
- Basic understanding of digital logic and computer architecture

### Installation and Usage

Provide step-by-step instructions on how to set up and run the MIPS processor simulation. For example:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ishaananish/MIPS.git
   cd MIPS
